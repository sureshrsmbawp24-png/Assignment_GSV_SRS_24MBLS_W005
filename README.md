The Green Comparative Advantage dataset (GreenCA)contains information about the comparative advantage in exporting low carbon technologies, that is to say, technologies having low CO2 emissions. More in detail, each row of the data collection represents a nation, which is characterized as having a high comparative advantage (label=1), thus, a comparative advantage index greater than 1, or having a low comparative advantage (label=0); and contains information about a set of indicators relating to the previously cited index. The value related to each feature is the mean of the values registered in the 2019-2021 three-year period.

If you use this data collection, please consider to cite the following paper (under review), which presents it:
